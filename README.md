<!-- Add your details -->

I am __Kenny Chiang__, an aspiring data analyst with 4.5 years of investment experience at J.P. Morgan's Private Bank in Singapore. Inspired by the rising trend of data analytics, I made the decision to switch careers and focus on my passion in research/analytics. I am a motivated self-starter, driven by solving complex problems with the willingness and desire to learn. I am also a strong communicator with the ability to tailor technical information for different audiences, honed by my prior experience as an investment advisor.
